        <p>Hi, my name is Christopher Werther but you can call me Chris. I am the son of a retired 30 year Chief Master
            Sargent of the U.S. Air Force. Being a military brat, I have lived in many places. I was born in Arizona at
            Luke Air Force Base, we then moved to Kent Ohio. Next we moved to the Air Force Acadamy where my dad worked
            in the infamous NORAD installation. We then moved to Naples Italy, Arkansas and finaly Ramstein Germany.
            After graduating from High School in Germany I took a year to travel europe. I 1995, I moved to Tucson
            Arizona and began college at the University of Arizona. There I met my wife of now 20 years. After
            transfering the Northern Arizona University Online campus and finishing my Bachelor's Degree while my wife
            went to Law School at Gonzaga University in Spokane Washington, I decided to explore my pasion in golf.

            <br>
            When we moved back to Phoenix, I got a job at a golf course where I quickly learned the day to day
            operations. I soon then began to teach golf. I even passed the PAT test to become a PGA Member and started
            to study the
            buiness adminstration part of PGA. After 2 years and some life experiences, I decided that this was not the
            path I truly wanted to take. After a year away, one of my former Head Golf Pro's called me and asked me if I
            would be interested in working for him at a Golf Management company overseeing 35 courses with the Email
            Marketing and Website Support. I took the chance and said yes. The job was great, I learned so much in a
            short amount of time and this is where I realized I really enjoyed the website design and coding of pages.
            After a year and half at the company, I decided that I wanted to become proficient in website design and
            coding. I am now going to school to become a website designer. My hope is to bring a skill and my passion
            for golf and begin creating spectacular golf course website designs! </p>
